# Terminal in SourceTree

Software like SourceTree and GitHub Desktop which offers a graphical user interface to users to ease the use of git commands, may or may not include all capabilities of the git for the simplicity. On the other hand, command line can always be used to run all git commands.<br/>

Since some of the git operations may or may not be included and must be done manually while using SourceTree, it has a shortcut to open the terminal for current repository.<br/><br/>
