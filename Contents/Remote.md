# Remotes, [git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote)
Remotes are the repositories which are in a remote machine. They are used to share code between other people. Local changes can be pushed to a remote so that other people can see it or changes can be pulled from remotes to get other people's changes to local machine. 

To be able to use a remote a repository can be created in GitHub. This repository can either be public (everyone can see it) or a private (only the owner and permitted people can see it).<br/><br/>

Copied URL can be used to create a remote.

After creating a remote, changes(commits) can be pushed to the remote so other people can get these.
```
git push origin master
```
