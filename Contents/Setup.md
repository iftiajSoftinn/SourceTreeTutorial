### Installing
Run the executable to start the installation process.
- Registration step can be skipped, or if you are using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/guides/getting-started/overview), it is possible to login through installer.
- After skipping the registration step, git and mercurial tools will automatically be downloaded and installed as a default.
- In advanced options automatic line ending handling can be selected. It will help conversion of line endings for different platforms and will set `git config core.autocrlf` to true. Detailed explanation can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings).
- After installation of the tools, by entering the name and email address which will be used to set git configurations(`git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email`) installation can be finished. They will be used as your identity while making commits. They can also be changed through the `Options` in SourceTree or with the git commands later.

Just after the installation, SourceTree will ask about loading an SSH key, this popup can be closed if you don't have an SSH key yet.
